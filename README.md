## Project Description

This application provides a command line interface to control almost any media player application that supports being controlled by a media keyboard. While it does not let you pick an individual song or playlist it does allow you to access the basic controls of the media player including play, pause, stop, next track, previous track, mute, volume up and volume down.


## Why?

This application was primarily designed for use with [Voice Attack](https://www.voiceattack.com) to allow for hands free control of your music and as such you will find a sample Voice Attack Profile included with the release.


## Usage

```
clmcontrol <Process Name> [-p] [-pp] [-pa] [-s] [-vm] [-mvm] [-vu] [-mvu] [-vd] [-mvd] [-nt] [-pt] [-?]
```
